        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Lia. I’m Chilean. I’m 28 years old. I’m a nutritionist. I studied for five years at Andrés Bello University in Chile and worked as a nutritionist for three years. I loved the career, but the job options were lower than expected. So, I decided to change my field and study something different, something I would like to do in the future and where I will find more job opportunities.   </p>
        <p>I arrived in Canada three months ago with my husband, dog, and cats. I am excited about this new adventure. So far, I love everything here, food, snow, culture, and the kindness of people. I want to travel around Canada in the future, especially to national parks, because I love hiking. In Chile, I went to almost all the national parks. So, I must continue my tradition.</p>
