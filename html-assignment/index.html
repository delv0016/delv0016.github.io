            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Lia. I'm Chilean. I'm 28 years old. I'm a nutritionist. 
                I studied at <abbr title="AndrÃ©s Bello National University">UNAB</abbr> in 
                Chile and graduated 8<sup>th</sup> in my generation. I worked as a nutritionist 
                for three years and liked the career, but the work options were lower than expected, 
                and the nutritionist's functions were modified in practice. So I decided to change 
                my field and study something different, something I would like to do in the future 
                and where I will find more job opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I arrived in Canada three months ago with my husband, dog, and cats. 
                I am <em>excited about this new adventure.</em>  So far, I love everything 
                here, food, snow, culture, and the kindness of people. I want to travel around 
                Canada in the future, especially to national parks, because I love hiking. In 
                Chile, I went to almost all the national parks. So, I must continue my tradition.
            </p>
